* Store model runs in sqlite (use the same code as timbre)
* Create LSTM arch
* Define input data and create a reader
* Define seed
* Try out that other model type
* Also try out markovify with spacy
* Try to apply spacy to LSTM? Add parts of speech, etc into LSTM? Can you do that in a generative model? Seems fine - given what you've seen so far, what's the next most likely part of speech to apply here?
